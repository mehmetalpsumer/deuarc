# DEU Electronic Universal Automatic Reduced Computer Simulator
### General
    DEUARC has:
    - 9 registers
        - Address Register
        - Program Counter
        - Stack Pointer
        - I/O Registers
        - Instruction Register
        - General purpose registers
    - 3 memory segments
        - Instruction Memory
        - Data Memory
        - Stack Memory

    DEUARC simulator converts the assembly code to machine code and simulates the program
    execution phases. It runs the program step by step while showing the phases of instruction
    cycle (fetch, decode, execute). 

    DEUARC simulator reads and parses the assembly code, then shows its label table and memory
    content table. The simulator shows contents of the registers, memory segments, computer
    operations and their micro operations. It provides switching between binary/hexadecimal/
    decimal numbers and exporting hex or mif file of the machine code.

### Operations
- Add
- Increment
- Double
- Divide by two
